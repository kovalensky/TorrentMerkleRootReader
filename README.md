Useful for finding the sources of the same copies of files on different trackers & DHT indexers that support BitTorrent v2 protocol, thus reviving dead torrents, valuable Internet artifacts.

> [!NOTE]  
> Generating magnet download links without duplicates is currently not available due to the [ongoing](https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent/issues/7439) issue with piece alignment files, hopefully it will be resolved soon.

Extract file hashes from .torrent files:
```
tmrr e example.torrent
```
Calculate hashes for existing files:
```
tmrr c your_file
```
Find duplicates within .torrent file(s):
```
tmrr d <example.torrent> <example2.torrent>.. <exampleN.torrent>
```
To save a large output:
```
tmrr your_command > output.txt
```
For the Linux environment on which PHP is installed:
```
php tmrr.php your_command
```
